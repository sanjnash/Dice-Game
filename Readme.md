# Dice-Game

This is a Java Dice-Game based on a game where dices are rolled and points are given according to the dice. 

The game has a dynamic statusbar, a sidebar which shows added player, a menu which is responsible for adding or removing player from the game, and a toolbar which is reponsible for rolling dice, placing a bet and cancelling a bet.
